![Trie Structure](assets/peepar.jpeg)
# Peepar

A fast and minimal Trie based HTTP router.

Peepar name is inspired by the **Peepal (Sacred fig) tree**, known for its deep roots and branching structure. Just like the tree, Peepar organizes routes using a Trie data structure, enabling fast and predictable path matching with very low overhead.

---

## Features

* Trie based routing for fast lookups
* Zero dependencies
* Very small footprint
* Middleware chaining support
* Dynamic route parameters
* Wildcard route matching
* Works in Node.js and Bun
* TypeScript types included
* Inbuilt params parsing

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install peepal-router
```

---

## Basic Usage

```js
import { TrieRouter } from "peepal-router";

const router = new TrieRouter();

// Global Middleware
router.pushMiddleware('/', function GlobalMiddleware1() => 'global middleware')
router.pushMiddleware('/', function Middleware2() => 'global middleware 2')


router.add("GET", "/", function handler () => "home");

const matchedhandler = router.search("GET", "/");

Output:
  {
    params: undefined,
    middlewares: [GlobalMiddleware1, GlobalMiddleware2],
    handler: [handler]
  }

// Route specific middleware
router.pushMiddleware("/users", function userMiddleware(ctx) => {
  console.log("/users middleware");
});
router.add("GET", "/users/:id", function userHandler() => "user profile");

const result = router.find("GET", "/users/42");
```

Output:

```js
{
  params: { id: "42" },
  middlewares: undefined,
  handler: [GlobalMiddleware1,GlobalMiddleware2,userMiddleware,userHandler]
}

```

`find()` (and its unstable `compiledFind()` backing) pre-bakes middlewares and the handler into one array at compile time, so `middlewares` is always `undefined` there. `search()`/`optimisedSearch()` keep them separate instead - see the shape above.

---

## Middleware
 - peepar supports global and route specific middleware

Global middleware:

```js
router.pushMiddleware("/", (ctx) => {
  console.log("global middleware");
});
```

Route specific middleware:

```js
router.pushMiddleware("/users", (ctx) => {
  console.log("/users middleware");
});
```

---

## Wildcard Routes

```js
router.add("GET", "/static/*", () => "HTML page");
```

Matches:

* /static/app.js
* /static/css/style.css
* /static/images/logo.png

---

## Performance

Peepar is designed for speed and low allocation during hot path. we try to minimise allocation and make our router fast as much as possible.

Key design goals:

* Try to Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot path
* Minimal overhead during lookup
* Fast static and dynamic route matching
* Lightweight and cache friendly structure

---

## API

### router.add(method, path, handler | handler[])
### router.insert(method, path, handler | handler[])

Register a route. Accepts one handler or an array of handlers for the same route/method.

### router.pushMiddleware(path, middleware)

Register middleware for a path or globally.

### router.search(method, path)
### router.optimisedSearch(method, path)
### router.find(method, path)

Find matching route and collect handlers.

Returns:

```ts
{
  params: Record<string, string> | undefined;
  middlewares: Function[] | undefined;
  handler: Function[] | undefined;
}
```

---

## Example

```js
import { TrieRouter } from "peepar";

const router = new TrieRouter();

router.pushMiddleware("/", () => console.log("global"));
router.pushMiddleware("/api/*", () => console.log("api middleware"));

router.add("GET", "/api/users/:id", () => console.log("user handler"));

const res = router.find("GET", "/api/users/100");

for (const fn of res.handler) {
  fn();
}
```

---

## Roadmap

* Route priority improvements
* Param parsing inbuilt in search method
* Optional parameter support
* Regex based params
* Zero allocation path parser
* Extended benchmarking
